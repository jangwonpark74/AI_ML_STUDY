# Preface
  - challenge:   Stochastic caculus for credit risk analysis
  - Response :   Take "Discrete-time stochastic Systems" class. 
    : Got to know first time during class, Probability applied to algorithms
    
  - View on Programmer's Job 
    : Programmers connect the flow of data
  - To make application really good you need to add a level of intelligence. <Well-build product>
  
  - Hire group of theoretical people, or "thinkers" and a set of pratical people, "doers".
  - Someone who can read papers, pull out the idea, implement it in real code, and iterate.

# On This book
  -  This book aims to be a bridge from algorithms presented in matrix form to an actual functional program. 
     (Heavy on program and light on mathematics)
## Audience
   - Machine learning : making sense of data.
   - Reader should have basic knowledge of python 

## Top 10 Algorithms in data mining 
   - Data and making data-based decisions are so important that even the content of this book born out of data.

## Organizations

### part 1 Machine learning basics 
  - classification  : the process of labeling items. 
  - k-Nearest Neighbors
  - Decision trees
  - probability distribution for classification and Naive Bayes algorithm
  - Logistic regression
  - Optimizing algorithm
  - How to deal with missing value in data
  - Support Vector Machines 
  - Adaboost ensemble method. 
  - Classification imbalance problem for training data 
  
### Part 2 Forcasting numeric values with regression 
  - discuss regression or predicting continuous values. 
  - regression, shinkage methods, and locally weighted linear regression
  - bias-variance tradeoff 

### Part 3 Unsupervised learning 
  - Unsupervised learning : We ask machine to tell us, "What do these data have in common?"
  - k-Means clustering
  - Apriori algorithm
  - an improved algorithm for association analysis called FP-Growth.
  
### Part 4 Additional tools
  - Mathematical operations used to remove noise from data. 
  - Discuss a tool used to scale machine learning to massive datasets that cannot be adequately addressed on a single machine. 

### How can you use the algorithms in the real world ?
  1. Get concept/algo working with very simple data
  2. Get real-world data in a format usable by our algorithm
  3. Put steps 1 and 2 togther to see the results on a real-world dataset
